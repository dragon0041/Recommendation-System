## Recommender System Overview
A recommender system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, social tags, and products in general. Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations and there are few ways in which it can be done. Two of the most popyular ways are â€“ through collaborative filtering or through content-based filtering.

Most internet products we use today are powered by recommender systems. Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, Pinterest, and long list of other internet products all rely on recommender systems to filter millions of contents and make personalized recommendations to their users. Recommender systems are well-studied and proven to provide tremendous values to internet businesses and their consumers.
